# Writing an io-auto-mode adapter

So you want to wire io-auto-mode into a runtime that isn't already supported. This is the short tour. The shipped adapters (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `openclaw`) are the canonical worked examples — none of them is more than ~250 LOC of glue.

The headline: **`core/` does the classification work**. An adapter's job is just to get a tool-call event out of the runtime, hand it to the classifier in the right shape, and translate the decision back. No classifier logic lives in adapter code; if you're tempted to put any there, push it into `core/` first.

Three shipped adapters, three different runtime surfaces, same five steps.

---

## The five contracts

### 1. Receive the hook event

Whatever shape the runtime gives you. Shipped patterns:

- **Cursor + Claude Code:** child process per hook firing. Stdin is hook-event JSON, stdout is a permission JSON. See `adapters/cursor/src/hook.ts` and `adapters/claude-code/src/hook.ts`.
- **OpenClaw:** long-lived plugin. Register a `before_tool_call` handler with the plugin API and accumulate transcripts in-process. See `adapters/openclaw/src/plugin.ts`.

If the runtime only gives you a one-shot stdin/stdout interface, you'll likely also want a side-channel cache for any context the runtime doesn't pass on each call — see "Optional: prompt cache" below.

Whichever pattern you're on, **load API keys before any imports that need them**. Hooks usually run in a sandboxed env that doesn't inherit the user's shell. The shipped adapters scan `~/.io-auto-mode/.env` then `~/io-data/.env` first thing in `hook.ts`.

### 2. Build the conversation context

The classifier needs the recent conversation as `ConversationMessage[]` (defined in `core/types.ts`). What goes in:

- The user prompt that led to this tool call (so prompt-injection text can't influence its own classification — see [Design principles](../README.md#design-principles))
- Any prior tool calls and their outputs in this turn
- The current tool call, framed as an `assistant` `tool_use` block

The shape is small:

```ts
interface ConversationMessage {
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'tool';
  content?: string | AssistantContentBlock[];
  source?: 'direct' | 'external' | 'agent';
  // ...
}
```

`source` matters. `'direct'` = user typed it. `'external'` = came from a tool result (PDF body, scraped page, MCP response — anywhere prompt injection can hide). `'agent'` = sub-agent output. The classifier weighs context differently per source.

Then call `serialiseTranscript()` (in `core/transcript.ts`) to convert your messages into `TranscriptEntry[]` — the shape `classify()` actually consumes.

### 3. Call the classifier

```ts
import { classify } from '../../../core/classifier.js';

const result = await classify(command, transcript, modelCall, config, {
  isMainSession,    // false in sub-agents / sandboxed exec — `ask` becomes `block`
  source: 'direct', // provenance of the *command* itself
});
```

`isMainSession` is the one that catches people. If the user can't see an `ask` prompt right now (sub-agent run, sandboxed background exec), pass `false` — the classifier will collapse `ask` → `block`, which is the right fail-closed choice. The Cursor adapter maps this from the hook payload's `sandbox` flag (`isMainSession = !sandbox`).

`config` is `ClassifierConfig` (model picks, mode, user pattern overrides). Read it from `~/.io-auto-mode/config.json` or your runtime's plugin config — see how each shipped adapter does `loadConfig()`.

### 4. Map the decision back

Core returns `'allow' | 'ask' | 'block'`. Your runtime probably has a similar shape with different vocabulary. Cursor uses `allow / ask / deny`; Claude Code uses `allow / ask / deny`; OpenClaw returns a result object. Keep the mapping in one tiny function so review is obvious:

```ts
function mapDecision(d: Decision): 'allow' | 'ask' | 'deny' {
  if (d === 'allow') return 'allow';
  if (d === 'ask') return 'ask';
  return 'deny';
}
```

**If the runtime only supports binary allow/deny on a given hook**, collapse `ask` → `deny` and surface the reason in the user-facing message. Cursor's `beforeReadFile` is the example — see `adapters/cursor/src/file-hook.ts` for the pattern.

### 5. Log + fail closed

```ts
logDecision(command, result, source, {
  adapter: 'my-runtime',
  conversationId: input.conversation_id,
  // ...any runtime-specific identity fields
});
```

The optional identity fields land in `auto-mode-log.jsonl` so audits can tell entries apart. The shape is `LogIdentity` in `core/types.ts` — extend it if your runtime exposes useful identity (workspace roots, user email, runtime version).

**Every error path returns `deny`.** `try/catch` around stdin parse, classifier call, log write — anything that can throw. Never let an exception leak through and produce no output, since "no decision" tends to be runtime-interpreted as "allow". The shipped adapters have a `failClosed()` helper at the top of `hook.ts` worth copying.

---

## Optional: file-zone classifier

For `Read` / `Write` / `Edit` tool calls, you don't want to burn an LLM call on every file touch. The pattern is a separate hook that does pure regex-based zone matching against `allowRead` / `allowWrite` / `deny` globs from `~/.io-auto-mode/config.json` + per-project `.io-auto-mode.json`.

Working implementation: `adapters/claude-code/src/file-hook.ts` and `adapters/cursor/src/file-hook.ts`. Both use the same merge logic (global + per-project, additive + deduped) and the same `realpathSync()`-then-glob-match flow. If your runtime has a file-read/write hook, copy one of those and adjust the dispatch.

The cursor file-hook also handles the dispatch case where one hook script handles two events (`beforeReadFile` and `preToolUse` Edit|Write) by routing on input shape — useful pattern if your runtime has the same.

---

## Optional: prompt cache

The classifier's prompt-injection guarantee depends on having the user prompt in context. Some runtimes (Cursor) don't pass the prompt to shell hooks — they only pass the prompt to a separate `beforeSubmitPrompt` hook. The fix: a small file-backed cache keyed by `conversation_id`, written by the prompt hook and read by the shell hook.

Shipped pattern: `adapters/cursor/src/prompt-store.ts`. ~30 lines, atomic-rename writes, best-effort reads, sanitised conversation IDs.

If your runtime *does* pass a transcript path or prompt directly into the shell hook (Claude Code), you can skip this — read the transcript file directly like `adapters/claude-code/src/read-transcript.ts` does.

---

## Provide a `ModelCallFn`

The classifier doesn't ship with a model client. You provide a function with this signature:

```ts
type ModelCallFn = (options: ModelCallOptions) => Promise<string>;
```

Both shipped TypeScript adapters use the same ~80 LOC `model-call.ts` that does provider-specific `fetch()` calls (Google Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI). It's not in `core/` only because we plan to migrate to AI SDK and rip the duplicated code out — see `specs/ai-sdk-migration.md`. For now, copy `adapters/cursor/src/model-call.ts` and use it as-is.

OpenClaw's adapter does it differently: it gets API keys via the OpenClaw runtime's auth API rather than reading env vars. Follow whichever pattern fits your runtime's secrets story.

---

## Build + ship

If you're following the shipped TypeScript pattern:

1. **Bundle with esbuild.** `scripts/build.mjs` already wires up the cursor + claude-code adapters; add a target block for yours. The build emits a single self-contained ESM file with a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang and `chmod +x` applied.
2. **Add a `bin` entry in `package.json`** so users can install the adapter via `npm install -g io-auto-mode` and reference it by name in the runtime's hook config.
3. **Add the dist + prompts dirs to the `files` whitelist in `package.json`** so they ship in the npm package.
4. **Tests under `tests/`** using the Node built-in test runner (`tsx --test`). Cover at minimum: dispatch routing, decision mapping, ask-collapse if applicable, symlink-resolved isMainModule check.

---

## Pre-merge checklist

- [ ] Hook event(s) covered for the runtime's full surface (shell, file-read, file-write/edit at minimum)
- [ ] Every error path returns deny — stdin parse, JSON parse, classifier call, log write
- [ ] `logDecision()` called with `adapter:` identity field set
- [ ] `ask` → `deny` collapse anywhere the runtime hook only supports binary
- [ ] `isMainSession` mapped from whatever sandbox / sub-agent signal the runtime exposes
- [ ] `realpathSync(process.argv[1])` in the isMainModule guard if invoked via `bin` symlink
- [ ] Tests covering dispatch, decision mapping, and any runtime-specific quirks
- [ ] esbuild target added to `scripts/build.mjs` with shebang + `chmod +x`
- [ ] `bin` entry in `package.json` plus `files` whitelist updated for `dist/` + `prompts/`
- [ ] `INSTALL.md` section explaining how to wire the runtime's hook config
- [ ] Spec under `specs/<runtime>-adapter.md` if the integration has any non-obvious mappings (worth doing — see `specs/cursor-adapter.md` for the bar)

---

## Worked examples

- **Cursor adapter** — `adapters/cursor/` + `specs/cursor-adapter.md`. Most complete example: four hooks, prompt cache, ask-collapse, full identity logging.
- **Claude Code adapter** — `adapters/claude-code/`. Cleanest stdin/stdout example, transcript file mining, two hooks (Bash + file).
- **OpenClaw adapter** — `adapters/openclaw/`. Plugin-API example, in-process transcript accumulation, runtime-managed secrets.
